# School District Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis
Due to evidence of academic dishonesty, the original analysis provided for the school board had to be redone.  This new analysis removes the reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders to avoid any potential breach of state-testing standards.

## Deliverable #1
The ninth-grade reading and math scores from Thomas High School were removed from the data set.  As you can see from the snip-it of the first and last (5) rows of the data frame below, their values were replaced with "NaN", while leaving the rest of the data set in tacked.
